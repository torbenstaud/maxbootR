Description: Implements state-of-the-art block bootstrap methods for extreme value 
  statistics based on block maxima. Includes disjoint blocks, sliding blocks, 
  and a generalized k-max transformation with circular recombination. 
  Fast C++ backends (via Rcpp) ensure scalability for large time series. 
  The methods follow the approach described in the paper ...
